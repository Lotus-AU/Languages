  Roles:
    Assassin:
      RoleName: Assassin
      Description: >-
        The Assassin is an Impostor that can also kill other players by guessing their roles. If the Assassin is able to successfully guess a player's role, then that player will be eliminated.


        While in meeting, the Assassin can select a player they want to guess by voting for them. After voting, the Guesser must use their Shapeshift Menu to select the role they wish to guess. If the Assassin correctly guesses both the player and their role, then that player will die.

        Due to limitations, some of the available guessing options will be sent in the chat.
        
        If the Assassin misguesses they will suicide. 


        To skip guessing, you may skip first before voting for a player.


        Note: Revealed roles (e.g. from Oracle) are unable to be guessed.
